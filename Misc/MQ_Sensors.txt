MQ5 DESCRIPTION:

Sensitive material of MQ-5 gas sensor is SnO2 [Indium Tin Oxide], which has lower 
conductivity in clean air. When the target combustible gas exists, the sensor has
higher conductivity and increases with increase in concentration of target gases. 
The target gases are:

1- Methane
2- Butane
3- Propane
4- Other combustible gases

MQ-5 gas sensor has:

- High sensitivity to LPG, natural gas , town gas 
- Low sensitivity to smoke & alcohol

MQ135 Description:

Sensitive material of MQ-5 gas sensor is also SnO2 [Indium Tin Oxide]. Sensor has 
high sensitivity to smoke and ammonia, and is more strongly related to air 
pollution.

UNITS:
The sensor measures conductivity and, therefore, only through calibration can the
units be derived.

In general, EPA (US Environment Protection Agency) refers to ppbv (parts per billion
by volume) or ppmv(parts per million by volume) to refer to air quality index.
