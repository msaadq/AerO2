# AerO2

“Mapping of the globe for regions ideal for athletes’ training and performance”

Description:
The objective of Aer02 is to enhance the training and performance of athletes by suggesting regions around them that have ideal air content suited to their health needs. 

The proposed system works in three main steps:
1-	Specialized sensors are used to map air pollution and smog concentrations over certain regions (such as sectors of Islamabad) using surveillance carried out by our participants.
2-	The information is fed to a machine learning algorithm to develop a relationship between oxygen concentration and various demographic and industrial factors such as population density, energy consumption, automobiles’ quantity and et cetera.
3-	AerO2 application suggests athletes certain places in a city which are best suited for performance.

Proposed Equipment:
1-	STM32 Microcontroller Hub 
2-	Smog Sensor and Air Quality Sensor
3-	Op-amps
4-	Bluetooth Module
5-	Android Device
6-	IAR Embedded Workbench (software)
7-	Intellij IDEA (software)

Group Members:
1-	Saad Qureshi (BEE5-B, 5804)
2-	Usman Mahmood Khan (BEE5-B, 5373)
3-	Muddassir Ahmed Khan (BEE5-B, 5891)
